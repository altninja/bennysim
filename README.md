# SelfKey Network Simulation Tool

## Overview

In order to build a robust and intelligently designed network, we will create a simulation infrastructure using agent based modeling, real world data and machine learning.  We can build small and large scale experiments using parts or all network components with as flexible configuration as possible in regards to agents enabled and granularity of flow tracking.  

## Infrastructure

### Tools

JS Simulator Library is used to manage the scheduler and agent interactions.  It's been modified to be used server side in a NodeJS application as opposed to in the browser as the original implementation.  This allows the benefit of being able to leverage server side libraries.

It is integrated with MongoDB using the Mongoose libarary.

It is running in an Express app and can be accessed via both a web based UI and from an API endpoint.

The web based UI is created using Pug as a templating system.  Uses Chart.js and jQuery DataTables to manage visual data representations.

Uses a Python Shell wrapper to allow access to the vast number of AI and Machine Learning libraries written in Python while still enjoying NodeJS as the primary runtime environment.

## How it works?

### Agent Based Modelling


### User Agent

can...
buy eth from an exchange
buy key from an exchange
sell eth to an exchange
sell key to an exchange
purchase multiple items from a vendor
deposit key to a staking contract
revoke key from a staking contract

### Exchange Agent


### Vendor Agent


### Affiliate Agent

### Payment Model

### Claim Model


## Installation

Install NodeJS
Install MongoDB
Install Python3
Git Clone
`npm i`
`npm run dev`
